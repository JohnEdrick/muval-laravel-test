# **Muval Code Test Instructions**

## **Overview**
This task is designed to assess your ability to:
1. Identify issues in a Laravel codebase.
2. Provide detailed feedback on the problems.
3. Fix the issues and improve the codebase by following Laravel best practices.
4. Extend the functionality to support new requirements.

You are provided with a Laravel project that contains intentional flaws. Your objective is to review the code, document your findings, and implement fixes and new requirements.

## **What You Need to Do**

### **1. Identify Issues**
- Review the codebase thoroughly.
- Document any issues you find, including:
    - What is wrong.
    - Why itâ€™s a problem.
    - How you would fix it.

### **2. Fix the Issues**
- Implement fixes for as many issues as possible within the allotted time.
- Refactor the codebase to follow Laravel best practices.
- Ensure your fixes address both functionality and maintainability.

### **3. Create API Endpoints**
- Turn the codebase into a set of API endpoints to manage tasks.
- Implement user authentication using Sanctum.

### **4. Test Your Changes**
- Test your fixes to ensure the application works as expected.
- Add unit or feature tests for key functionality.

### **5. Provide Deliverables**
Prepare the following deliverables:
1. **Download project**
   Download the project files.
2. **Issue Report (`report.md`)**  
   Write a detailed report of the issues you identified, why they are problematic, and how you fixed or would fix them. Include a breakdown of the changes you have made to meet the new API requirements.
3. **Refactored Codebase**  
   Write comments next to the code you refactored to outline why you changed the code.
4. **Tests**  
   Include unit or feature tests for code coverage in the Zip file.
5. **Submit**  
   Compress your solution into a Zip file and send to nicole@muval.com.au. Please do not push your changes to the repo.

## **What to Look For**

### **Key Areas to Review**
1. **Security**
    - Are there any security vulnerabilities?
2. **Code Quality**
    - Is the code well-structured, reusable, and maintainable?
3. **Performance**
    - Are there performance bottlenecks?
4. **Best Practices**
    - Does the code follow Laravel conventions and best practices?
5. **Testing**
    - Are there tests? If not, consider where they might be useful.
      
## **Technical Requirements**

### **Environment Setup**
1. Download the project.
2. Use the .env.example file to configure your .env file.

### **Project Features**
The application is a basic task management system with the following:
- **Task Management**: Create, view, and edit tasks.
- **User Assignment**: Each task is associated with a user.
- **API Endpoints**: Implement a set of API endpoints to manage tasks with Sanctum authentication.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
You will be evaluated on:

1. **Depth of Analysis**
    - Did you identify the key issues in the codebase?
    - Were your observations accurate and well-explained?
2. **Quality of Fixes**
    - Are the fixes aligned with Laravel best practices?
    - Did you refactor the codebase to follow Laravel best practices?
    - Is the code more secure, maintainable, and performant after your changes?
3. **API Implementation**
    - Did you implement the API endpoints correctly?
    - Are the endpoints secure and follow best practices?
    - Are the endpoints well-documented?
    - Is Sanctum properly configured for authentication?
4. **Code Readability**
   - Is the refactored code clean and easy to understand?
5. **Testing**
    - Did you add meaningful tests for key features or fixes?
    - Do the tests cover the codebase adequately?

## **BONUS**
If you have extra time, consider submitting the following:
- Download the `main` branch of `https://github.com/muval-apps/muval-bonus-test`
- Build an SPA using Vue3 and TailwindCSS to consume the API.
- Compress your solution into a Zip file and send to nicole@muval.com.au. Please do not push your changes to the repo.

## **Due Date**
Please submit your solution, including the bonus test if you choose to do that, by **5pm AEST, 12/12/2024**.
